Proof-of-Concept( PoC ) application that returns a greeting. It is indended to be called by another application that composes a "_Greeter name!_" output. For example for "_Hello world!_" this app would be the one providing the "_Hello_".

## Intended use

The purpose of this application is to be used for microservices tech demos and example implementations of tools.

**It is in no way, shape, or form a reference for best practices, a good example, or a comprehensive anything**. It is a minimal skeleton app with simple logic that can be built around.
